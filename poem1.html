the simple, conditioned intuition of some lustful moment; or was it that
rare extraction from someone’s absolute, limitless love?</p><p>is our history laid down in darkness, veiled from us by our mother’s
belly? before time greets us at a great dawn of future existence? are
all things pinned to these places like iron pegs holding down or up an
entire big top?</p><p>mundane spots and blobs of colour seed doubt as enamel braves
earliest armour against the focal blooming of devices collecting future
scars</p><p>what thoughts we keep deep within us, unable to mutter or whisper it,
to forsake all that noise from slamming together into a great
confluence, and all of us becoming lost in ribboned waves</p><p>who regrets telling someone they loved them, too many times?</p><p>who regrets firm words from cruel mouths?</p><p>who regrets placing the health of numbers above needs of weary
hearts?</p><p>and so, we tumble and tumble until the world is forever spinning and
our heads forever bruised.</p><p>atomic habits of severely successful people</p><p>waking at 5am for Tai Chi, pilates or jogging</p><p>to provide single abstraction of thought</p><p>journeys of ruthless prioritisation never forgetting</p><p>what they need to do, keeping that saw sharp</p><p>business insider, rich maths trend linear matrices</p><p>to share and validate, these habits of severe success,</p><p><em>they will eat your bread, but they will sing your song</em></p><p>flying goose, forgetful beaver</p><p>fastener salesman from Genoa</p><p>beckons the South China Sea</p><p>to regurgitate on the Kent shore</p><p>are we entirely sure poets are even best placed</p><p>to be specifying simile and|or metaphor</p><p>i bet you want your own personalised just for you</p><p>i will leave a space free so a bot can fill in those bits</p><p>shall we say #metaphor | #simile | click here</p><p>to give consent for your data to be shared</p><p>so our algorithms will get right on that for you</p><p>sweet you - a strategy of veiled feelings</p><p>a limited uniqueness cups the increasing pursuit</p><p>to make the real seem even rarer</p><p>it’s easy to be headstrong and confident</p><p>but it’s easier to lose a finger when</p><p>attempting to change a leopard’s spots</p><p>quick email quick website</p><p>data centres go mad in the night</p><p>let’s rhapsodise yeah I vow to thee</p><p>as long as the land lies incomplete</p><p>entire &amp; whole &amp; perfect my love</p><p>my service that asks no questions</p><p>we’ll send you a text when</p><p>your package is out for delivery</p><p>our driver will lay it upon your altar</p><p>so that you will not pay final sacrifice</p><p>we hope you enjoy your thing</p><p>we hope it’s what you wanted</p><p>that it never falters we take pride</p><p>in what we do &amp; it’s suffering</p><p>you see we do this all day long</p><p>sorting the parcels &amp; dispatching</p><p>QR codes little fuzzy messages</p><p>to the outside world we dream</p><p>that it’s floating &amp; soul by soul</p><p>hope it’s bounds increase know that</p><p>all our ways are ways of gentleness</p><p>&amp; all our paths are peace</p><p>port cranes turn the cargo parallax</p><p>to tepid oilblue sky and walls</p><p>of stacked containers, red lights</p><p>blinking glowworm from pierview</p><p>stripping light’s flow to balcony</p><p>of advent palladio watching,</p><p>handsome age of declining will.</p><p>the C-suite’s homes have prime position</p><p>in their investment grade portfolios</p><p>stirrups don’t stop the horse from bolting,</p><p>but they give you a chance of staying on.</p><p>the textbooks say, <em>markets are efficient.</em></p><p>but what if the efficiency is removing</p><p>hard assets from soft hands? when did you</p><p>stop wanting the touch of my soft hands?</p><p>are we the hairs of some submerged root,</p><p>that seeks to bring nutrients to a larger thing?</p><p>or are we segments of it, burrow watchers, priests</p><p>of deadly shrines.
